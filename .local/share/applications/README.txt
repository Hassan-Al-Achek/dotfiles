Files places here are modifications of the original .desktop files of some
applications pulled as a dependency by gnome. The intention is to hide them from
the application grid, as they can't be uninstalled and don't provide any useful
functionality to the user.

If you want to hide any other application, copy here the corresponding .desktop
file from /usr/share/applications and add the parameter NoDisplay=true
